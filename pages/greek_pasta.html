    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces whole wheat penne pasta</li>

        <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon butte</li>

        <li>1 (1 pound) beef rib eye steak</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>

        <li>¼ cup chopped shallots</li>

        <li>1  tablespoon soy sauce</li>

        <li>½ cup sun-dried tomato pesto</li>

        <li>½ cup sliced black olives</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        

        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente. When cooked, drain, then toss with olive oil, and keep warm.
        </li>
         <li>Meanwhile, melt 1 tablespoon butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Sear the rib-eye on both sides until rosy-pink in the center, 7 to 10 minutes depending on thickness. Remove steak from skillet and cut into bite-size pieces. Melt the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter in the skillet, and stir in the garlic and shallots. Cook 5 to 10 seconds until fragrant, then return the steak to the pan and cook for another 5 minutes or to desired doneness. Stir in the soy sauce, and cook a few seconds longer, allowing it to evaporate.
        </li>

        <li>Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in the sun-dried tomato pesto, olives, spinach, basil, parsley, feta cheese and sunflower kernels. Toss with the pasta in a large bowl and serve. 
        </li>    
    </ol>
